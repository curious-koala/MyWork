# Nikhar Flask App- Azure Web Service Deployment
Cretaed a flask based app using python that can take input (string) and finds and replaces specific Keywords on the output.

# Replacement Code:

The code essentially works on a list on words. It finds and replaces the word with word+copyright symbol via flask app.

# Infrastructure:
I have used falsk for creating the app in python. I have used Azure web services to host the app. https://nikharflaskapp1.azurewebsites.net
User will get to see the keywords which will be found and replaced in the input queries. 
Github is used for CI/CD implementation of the code into the Azure web App services.

# Query 

Users can put their query and see the results on the endpoint https://nikharflaskapp1.azurewebsites.net/requests?input= (Enter your String).
